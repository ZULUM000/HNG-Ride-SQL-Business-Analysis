#  HNG Ride SQL Business Analysis

**Data Analytics Track – Stage 2A Task**

---

##  Project Overview

HNG Ride is a mid-sized transportation company operating in North America. Management wants to analyze ride operations from **June 2021 to December 2024** to assess performance, trends, and areas for improvement.

As a **Data Analyst**, my task was to:

* Clean and validate the messy datasets.
* Write SQL queries to answer critical business questions.
* Summarize actionable insights in a clear, concise business report.

---

##  Objectives

1. Clean and prepare the dataset by addressing duplicates, inconsistent values, and invalid entries.
2. Analyze the data using SQL to extract key performance insights.
3. Present findings that can guide management’s decision-making.

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation

Steps taken during data preparation:

* **Removed duplicates** across tables.
* **Handled missing values** in payments, rides, and users tables.
* **Corrected inconsistent city names** (e.g., “New York City”, “NYC”, “newyork”).
* **Validated data integrity** by ensuring:

  * Positive fares and distances.
  * Valid driver ratings (between 1 and 5).
  * Logical timestamps (ride start < ride end).
* Filtered dataset to only include rides from **June 2021 – December 2024**.

##  Business Questions & SQL Queries

### 1️⃣ Top 10 Longest Rides

Find the 10 longest rides by distance with details including driver, rider, cities, and payment method.

### 2️⃣ Rider Retention

How many riders who signed up in 2021 still took rides in 2024?

### 3️⃣ Quarterly Revenue Growth

Compare quarterly revenue between 2021–2024 and determine which quarter had the highest year-over-year (YoY) growth.

### 4️⃣ Driver Consistency

For each driver, calculate their average monthly rides since signup and find the top 5 with the highest consistency.

### 5️⃣ City Cancellation Rate

Calculate the cancellation rate per city and identify which city has the highest rate.

### 6️⃣ Non-Cash Riders

Identify riders who have completed more than 10 rides but never paid with cash.

### 7️⃣ Top 3 Drivers per City

Find the top 3 drivers in each city by total revenue earned between June 2021 and December 2024 (based on pickup city).

### 8️⃣ Bonus Qualification
